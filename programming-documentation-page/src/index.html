        <h2>Definition</h2>
      </header>
      <p>Object-Oriented Programming is an approach to problem solving. It has become the most widely used approach to software development</p>

        <h2>Classes</h2>
      </header>
      <p>A class is a concept / a blueprint / a basic structure of an object. They're very useful in programming when we need several instances of an object because it avoids us the work of describing each object individually.</p>
      <p>For example, a car is an instance of the class <code>Vehicle</code>.

    <section class="main-section" id="objects">
      <header>
        <h2>Objects</h2>
      </header>
      <p>An object is a component of a program that knows how to perform certain actions and how to interact with other elements of the program. Objects are the basic units of object-oriented programming.</p>
      <p>To continue with our example:
        <code>car = Vehicle.new</code>
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="methods">
      <header>
        <h2>Methods</h2>
      </header>
      <p>A method is a procedure that defines the behavior of the objects created from a class. We can think of them as actions that an object can perform</p>
      </code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="functions">
      <header>
        <h2>Functions</h2>
      </header>
      <p>A function is a combination of instructions that need some input (arguments) and is meant to achieve some result.</p>
      <p>The difference between a function and a method is that the functions is independent. That means that you can use it anywhere and it doesn't need an object to work.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="variables">
      <header>
        <h2>Variables</h2>
      </header>
      <p>A variable is a container that holds information that can be referenced and manipulated in a computer program.</p>
      <h2>Types of variables</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Constants</li>
        <p>They are used for storing data that never needs to change.</p>
        <p><code>MY_CONSTANT = "I am a constant and I'll never change"</code></p>
        <li>Global variables</li>
        <p> They are available throughout your entire app, overriding all scope boundaries. </p>
        <p><code>$global_variable = "I'm available through your app"</code></p>
        <li>Class variables</li>
        <p>They are accessible by instances of your class, as well as the class itself.</p>
        <p><code>@@brand = "Audi"</code></p>
        <li>Instance variables</li>
        <p> They are available throughout the current instance of the parent class.</p>
        <p><code>@var = 'I am available throughout the current instance of this class.'</code></p>
        <li>Local variables</li>
        <p>They are the most common variables you will come across and obey all scope boundaries.</p>
        <p><code>var = 'I must be passed around to cross scope boundaries.'</code></p>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="arrays">
      <header>
        <h2>Arrays</h2>
      </header>
      <p>An array is a data structure, which can store a fixed-size collection of elements of the same data type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.</p>
